Hi there, and welcome to chrisdieckhaus.github.io. I've created this site for a couple of reasons.

1. As a computer science student and future computer science employee, I felt it was important to have my own website. It's professional, and gives me a chance to showcase my web design skills (I created this site completely from scratch. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/chrisdieckhaus/chrisdieckhaus.github.io).
2. In addition to code, the site gives me a means to display my photography work. It's going to take me a while to curate all the photographs I wish to put on the site, but once complete, it gives me a great, personal online portfolio.
3. As Allen Iverson once said, "We're talkin' bout practice." Building this site has been a massive learning experience for me, and my HTML and CSS skills have increased tenfold by doing this.
4. Finally, the blog feature of this site provides a perfect means of communication for my upcoming semester abroad at the University of St. Andrews. We'll see how long I keep up with it, but as of now, it'll be the easiest way for people to follow my adventures in Scotland.

Other than Scotland, I'm not sure what this blog will be used for. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
